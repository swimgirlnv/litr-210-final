      <h3>Sacramento</h3>
      <p>
      Cyane can’t cry. She thought at first it was because she’s around people all day and she just needs to find a nice quiet place at night and then she will be able to let it out. She knows the emotion is there, it swells in her chest and burns like ice and fire, making it impossible to breathe or move. But even at night, under the watchful eye of the moon, she can’t cry.
      </p>
      <p>
      Time has passed since Kore moved, and Cyane and her father had moved too. Away from the world of mystic wonder and freedom and into the world that would prepare Cyane for a successful future. A new school that prided itself on academic excellence and rigorousness, new people who cared most about grades and the reality of their impending future and growing up quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
      There is no magic in Sacramento.
      </p>
      <p>
      Despite this, Cyane still longingly searches for a message from the moon, the only thing that has remained the same since she descended from her mountains and into the flatlands. Each night she opens her window shades a little to look out onto the street, hating that the street lamps dim the glory of the moon. And each night she will say
      <i>Hello. I wish you would speak to me. I am so alone here.</i> And each night, after staring out the window and feeling like a fool, she would close the blinds again and think about her grades and the reality of her impending future and growing up.

      Her friend, the moon, is just a rock reflecting light in space.

      <p>
      Cyane doesn’t dance or ski anymore. Skiing is obvious, you need snow and a mountain to do that and Sacramento is hot enough to fry an egg on the concrete. With ballet, she had different partners and she would try to be there for them but she just could never find the same flow that she had felt with Kore. And the thought of Kore would make the pain return and she would sit there like a shaken carbonated soda hoping someone would come pop the tab so she could finally overflow.
      </p>
      <p>
      Cyane does swim, though. A newer activity, one never tainted by Kore, one that felt so natural and right that she spent all hours outside of school in the pool. At first, it was just fun, Cyane and her dad would go to the local gym and swim laps together. Up and down and up and down the lane, admiring the unchanging nature of the single black line at the bottom of the lane. But eventually, Cyane wanted more because, thinking about the reality of her impending future and growing up, it might not be a bad thing to join a club sport. And so began the practices at five in the morning, at first with her father driving her to the pool, but eventually, she begins to drive herself.      </p>
      <p>
      There is a freedom like flying that comes from driving on an empty five-lane freeway in the pitch dark of the early early morning. No one on the road, and the moonlight turning the world monochrome. Cyane would roll her windows down and turn her music all the way up, sprinting along the freeway with maybe one other car. It was exhilarating. As seasons changed to fall and the tule fog began to form, Cyane continued to roll down her windows to allow the fog to ride in the car with her. A ridiculous notion, she knew, but sometimes she felt like it was having a comforting force alongside her.
      </p>
      <p>
      Cyane began to talk to the tule fog, a silent keeper of secrets as she drove to practice. She told the tule fog about Kore, about Tahoe, about life in Sacramento. About how her dad had told her about San Francisco but wouldn’t tell her about her mother. Who needs a therapist when you have fog?      </p>
    <p>
    “You know, when I first saw Kore, she was made of wind and snow. There is something magical about Tahoe that just isn’t here, although maybe it is and I haven’t seen it. Or, maybe you are like Kore, but just haven’t shown your face yet,” Cyane laughs and elbows the air in her passenger seat.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I think I’ve officially lost it,” She sighs.
    </p>
    <p>
    Pulling into the pool parking lot, Cyane turned off her music and cut her lights, admiring the moonlight shining faintly through the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
    “You know, I talked to the moon when I was little. He was my friend. He would smile at me, and I would smile back, and it was awesome. But I try talking to him now and he can’t hear me. I think I am too far away, too close to sea level,” Cyan looked at the fog spilling into the car, then quickly pinched herself to make sure she wasn’t dreaming she was in the parking lot. (It had happened before).
    </p>
    <p>
    “But at least I have you, you’re comforting, somehow.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Cyane paused, thinking. The branches of the trees surrounding the parking lot swayed a bit in a light breeze, swirling the fog and casting shadows in the front seat, making it look as if someone were there, just for a second.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’m grateful for your company. I’d love to meet you someday.”
